Running Tests
-------------

Prerequisites
-------------

PHPUnit
=======

phpBB unit tests use PHPUnit framework. Version 3.3 or better is required
to run the tests. PHPUnit prefers to be installed via PEAR; refer to
http://www.phpunit.de/ for more information.

PHP extensions
==============

Unit tests use several PHP extensions that board code does not use. Currently
the following PHP extensions must be installed and enabled to run unit tests:

- ctype
- pdo
- pdo_database for whichever database you want to use for testing (e.g. pdo_sqlite)

Configuration file
------------------

A configuration file called test_config.php must be created in tests directory
containing database connection parameters. It is used by tests involving database.

A configuration file for sqlite may be created with the following command:

$ cat >test_config.php <<EOT
<?php
\$dbms = 'sqlite';
\$dbhost = '';
\$dbport = '';
\$dbname = ':memory:';
\$dbuser = '';
\$dbpasswd = '';
EOT

Running
-------

Once the prerequisites are installed, run the tests from tests directory:

$ phpunit all_tests.php
